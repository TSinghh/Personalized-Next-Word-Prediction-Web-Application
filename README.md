# Personalized-Next-Word-Prediction-Web-Application
- Built a Flask-based web application leveraging N-gram modeling to predict the next word in a sentence, showcasing expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- Utilized a pre-processed dialogs dataset, removing non-alphabetic characters and standardizing text to lowercase to enhance model accuracy.
- Developed probabilistic N-gram models (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams) to compute word co-occurrence patterns and predict the most likely subsequent word.
- Implemented a trigram-based probabilistic framework, normalizing probabilities for robust prediction results.
- Delivered dynamic JSON-based responses and an interactive user interface via Flask's templating system.
